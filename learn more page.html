            <h2 class="titreh2">Key Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainability: How can the cafeteria adopt more sustainable practices to reduce waste and reliance on plastic?</li>
                <li>Food Waste: How can we repurpose leftovers, and encourage feedback to limit food waste?</li>
                <li>Plastic Waste: What alternatives can replace plastic packaging to minimize environmental impact?</li>
                <li>Awareness: How can we raise awareness among students to take ownership of their waste and recycling habits?</li>
                <li>Staff Engagement: How can staff be better trained and equipped to manage food waste, recycling, and educate students?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="titreh2">how does our solution to these problems work? </h2>
            <p>Students and staff can book and pay for meals in advance on the EcoNeo website.
                This website is accessible directly from the Neomagora platform. 
                EcoNeo is synchronized with student accounts to avoid having to create an additional profile.
                On EcoNeo, you can visualize available dishes each day with details when you click on them (ingredients, prices, vegetarian options, etc.)
                <br>To benefit from this solution, order 24h before the lunch time.
                You have the ability to select additional options such as drinks or desserts.
                We are also going to implement a Loyalty points system to reward regular users.
                There are notifications to remind you of pick-up times for meals ordered.
                With the EcoNeo solution you have a guaranteed availability of meals on arrival.
                <br><br>To view the weekly cafeteria and canteen menu, go to the Pre order page. 
                Then click on any day of the calendar to be redirected to a page where you can choose and reserve your meal.
